I attended an interesting webinar last week that Fred Treyz, CEO of
\href{https://remi.com}{REMI.com}, presented about inflation,
transportation, and oil shocks. Although the entire webinar was
informative and throught-provoking,\footnote{All slides shown during the
  webinar and a video recording of the webinar are available at
  \href{https://www.remi.com/event/transportation-inflation-and-the-supply-chain/}{the
  REMI.com web site}} I found that three slides encasulated well the
components of inflationary and deflationary dynamics and their
differential effects on various social and economic classes. Then,
summarized on two slides are the results of simulations a 10\% hike in
the price of oil that Fred shared.

Various forces can increase or decrease consumer prices in complex
ways.\footnote{ \emph{Monetary policy} is the process by which the
  government, central bank, or monetary authority manages the supply of
  money, or trading in foreign exchange markets. \emph{Fiscal policy}
  attempts to influence the direction of the economy through changes in
  government spending or taxes. On top of these policies, we have
  experienced severe \emph{supply-chain disruptions} and \emph{labor
  shortages} that added to inflationary pressures.}

\footnote{\emph{Technology} can make production more efficient.
  \emph{Globalization} promotes trade with low-cost producers.
  \emph{Aging} make different consumption choices. \emph{Remote} work
  reduces costs of transportation and improves access to labor
  independent of geography.}\includegraphics{defl1.jpg}

\footnote{Simply put, inflation degrades the well-being of lower income
  groups more than high-income/wealth groups. Lower income groups spend
  a high proportion of their wages on necessities that higher income
  groups, which have more cushion to buy higher priced necessities and
  discretionary consumption}\includegraphics{inflpacts.jpg}

\subsection{\texorpdfstring{\textbf{Role of Transportation in Inflation
and
Deflation}}{Role of Transportation in Inflation and Deflation}}\label{role-of-transportation-in-inflation-and-deflation}}

Transportation is a major and direct driver of labor productivity.
\footnote{Transportation impediments have dented our supply chain
  significantly. Labor shortages amplify these transportation
  difficulties.} \includegraphics{trans1.jpg}

\footnote{The possibility of \emph{stagflation} is a worry. A period of
  slow economic growth and high unemployment (i.e., stagnation) can
  combine with rising prices (i.e., inflation) to create a
  recession(i.e., a business cycle contraction when there is a general
  decline in overall economic activity).}\includegraphics{trans2.jpg}
